# NFT Drop

A NFT Project created on the Agoric Blockchain using its Smart Contract Framework: Zoe

----------------------------

## Description:

This project is an NFT Store with all the basic features of smart contracts where you can Buy NFTs for 1 RUN.

It was very hard setting up and getting started with blockchain for the first time as a beginner but agoric made it possible.

The dapps are built on top of the [dapp-fungible-faucet](https://github.com/Agoric/dapp-fungible-faucet) template from Agoric.

Reference was taken from youtube tutorials and livestream by Kate and other Agoric Developers.

The largest thing which I learnt through this project was how to write a Drop Contract, but it couldn't be included in the project due to the hackathon time limits and troubles integrating the frontend with NFT Drops.
